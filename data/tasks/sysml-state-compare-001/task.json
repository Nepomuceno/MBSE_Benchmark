      "comparison_thoroughness": "1.0: Correctly identifies all state differences (hovering in A, waiting in B) and all transition differences (emergency→idle in B only, flying→hovering vs flying→waiting). 0.5: Identifies most differences but misses some details. 0.0: Fails to identify major differences.",
      "equivalence_analysis": "1.0: Correctly determines that machines are NOT behaviorally equivalent due to: (1) different intermediate state names (hovering vs waiting) which may have different semantics, and (2) emergency→idle transition in B but not in A. Explains reasoning clearly. 0.5: Correct determination but weak or incomplete reasoning. 0.0: Incorrect determination or no reasoning.",
      "scenario_quality": "1.0: Provides valid input sequence that demonstrates difference, such as [StartupSignal, TakeoffSignal, LandSignal, TakeoffSignal] showing hovering vs waiting, or [StartupSignal, TakeoffSignal, EmergencySignal, ResetSignal] showing emergency→landed→idle vs emergency→idle. Clearly explains the different paths. 0.5: Scenario provided but explanation unclear or incomplete. 0.0: No scenario or invalid scenario.",
      "structural_understanding": "1.0: Demonstrates understanding of state machine structure, recognizes that state names matter (hovering vs waiting suggests different semantics), and identifies that both reachability and state semantics affect equivalence. 0.5: Basic structural understanding but misses nuances. 0.0: Poor understanding of state machine concepts."
