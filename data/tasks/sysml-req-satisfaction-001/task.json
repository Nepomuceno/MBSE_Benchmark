The component satisfying it (full path/name)\n3. Whether the satisfaction can be verified from the model (check if constraints pass based on attribute values)\n\nFormat your response as:\n\n**Requirement**: [requirement name]\n**Satisfied by**: [component name/path]\n**Verification**: [PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN] - [explanation based on constraint and values]\n\nAnalyze all satisfy relationships in the model.",
