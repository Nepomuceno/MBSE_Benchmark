Create a state def 'TrafficLightController' with states:\n   - Red\n   - Yellow\n   - Green\n   - Emergency (accessible from any state)\n3. Define transitions:\n   - Red → Green after 30 seconds\n   - Green → Yellow after 25 seconds\n   - Yellow → Red after 5 seconds\n   - Any state → Emergency via EmergencySignal event\n4. Use proper state def syntax with time events and signal events\n\nReturn only the SysML v2 code, no explanation.",
