  "prompt": "Given the requirements model and the system component model, analyze the requirement coverage.\n\nIdentify:\n1. **Satisfied Requirements**: Requirements that have satisfy relationships with components and constraints are met (provide evidence from the model)\n2. **Unsatisfied Requirements**: Requirements that have NO satisfy relationships in the component model\n3. **Partially Satisfied Requirements**: Requirements that have satisfy relationships but constraints may not be fully met\n\nFor each unsatisfied requirement, suggest which component(s) in the system model might logically satisfy it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n\n## Satisfied Requirements\n- [Requirement name]: Satisfied by [component] - [evidence]\n\n## Unsatisfied Requirements\n- [Requirement name]: Not satisfied - Suggest: [component suggestion with reasoning]\n\n## Partially Satisfied Requirements\n- [Requirement name]: Satisfied by [component] but [constraint issue]",
