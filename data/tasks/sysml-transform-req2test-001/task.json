  "description": "Transform SysML v2 requirements into corresponding verification test cases with proper traceability",
  "prompt": "Transform these SysML v2 requirements into verification cases. For each requirement definition:\n\n1. Create a verification case definition with a name like 'Verify_<RequirementName>'\n2. Define test setup (preconditions) based on the requirement attributes\n3. Define test procedure (test actions) that would verify the requirement\n4. Define pass/fail criteria derived from the requirement's 'require constraint'\n5. Add a 'verify' relationship linking the verification case back to the original requirement\n6. Include objective documentation explaining what is being verified\n\nCreate a new package 'HVACSystemVerification' containing all verification cases.\n\nExample structure:\nverification def VerifyTemperatureRegulation {\n    doc /* Verification case for temperature regulation requirement */\n    \n    // Test setup\n    attribute testSetTemp : Temperature;\n    attribute measuredTemp : Temperature;\n    \n    // Acceptance criteria from requirement\n    assert constraint { abs(measuredTemp - testSetTemp) <= 1 }\n    \n    verify requirement HVACSystemRequirements::TemperatureRegulationReqDef\n}\n\nOutput valid SysML v2 verification package.",
