Each 'port def' becomes a class with <<port def>> stereotype\n3. Specialization (:> or specializes) becomes inheritance arrow (<|--)\n4. Part usages (parts within a part def) become composition (*--)\n5. Attributes become class members with their types\n6. Port usages become associations with appropriate stereotypes\n7. Use clear, hierarchical layout directives for readability\n\nThe PlantUML should render a clear architecture diagram showing the system structure and relationships.\n\nOutput only valid PlantUML code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml.",
