The system shall respond to user input within 100 milliseconds\n3. Operating temperature range shall be -20°C to 50°C\n\nRequirements:\n1. Package named 'SystemRequirements'\n2. Import ISQ::* and ScalarValues::*\n3. Create three requirement definitions:\n   - BatteryCapacityReq\n   - ResponseTimeReq\n   - OperatingTempReq\n4. Include doc strings describing each requirement\n5. Add constraint expressions where appropriate\n\nReturn only the SysML v2 code, no explanation.",
