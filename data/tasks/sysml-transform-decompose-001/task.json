  "prompt": "Refactor this monolithic SysML v2 model into separate packages for better organization:\n\n1. 'Definitions' package - all part defs, port defs, interface defs, connection defs, item defs, attribute defs\n2. 'Actions' package - all action defs and use case defs\n3. 'States' package - all state defs\n4. 'Model' package - the actual part usages and model instances\n\nFor each package:\n- Create a separate file (Definitions.sysml, Actions.sysml, States.sysml, Model.sysml)\n- Add proper import statements where one package uses elements from another\n- Ensure all cross-references use correct qualified names or imports\n- Preserve all documentation and comments\n\nAll four files must be valid SysML v2 and together represent the complete original model.\n\nOutput each file clearly separated with file name headers.",

      "correct_imports": "1.0: All four packages have correct import statements where needed (e.g., Model imports from Definitions, Actions, States using proper syntax like 'import Definitions::*;'). 0.5: Some imports present but incomplete or syntax errors. 0.0: Missing or incorrect imports causing unresolved references.",
      "semantic_preservation": "1.0: All functionality identical after decomposition - Person definition works the same, Family relationships preserved, use cases intact. 0.5: Most functionality preserved but minor issues. 0.0: Semantic changes or broken functionality.",
      "organization_quality": "1.0: Logical, maintainable organization that improves code clarity and follows package separation best practices. 0.5: Organized but could be improved. 0.0: Poor organization or confusing structure.",
      "sysml_syntax_validity": "1.0: All four output files are valid SysML v2 with proper package syntax. 0.5: Minor syntax errors in one or two files. 0.0: Major syntax errors across files."
