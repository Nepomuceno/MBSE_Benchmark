Create part definitions:\n   - GPSReceiver with attribute accuracy : ISQ::LengthValue\n   - MapDisplay with attribute resolution : Integer\n   - RouteCalculator with attribute maxWaypoints : Integer\n4. Define port types for:\n   - GPS signals (latitude, longitude)\n   - User input\n   - Display output\n5. Create a subsystem part that instantiates these components and connects them\n6. Include 2 requirements:\n   - PositionAccuracyReq: accuracy shall be within 5 meters\n   - ResponseTimeReq: route calculation shall complete within 2 seconds\n\nReturn only the SysML v2 code, no explanation.",
