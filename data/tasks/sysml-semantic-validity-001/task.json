  "prompt": "This SysML v2 code is intended to be syntactically correct but may have semantic errors.\n\nAnalyze the code and identify any semantic issues such as:\n1. References to undefined types or elements\n2. Invalid type specializations (wrong parent type)\n3. Undefined port or part types\n4. Missing or incorrect imports\n\nFor each issue found, explain:\n- What is referenced that doesn't exist\n- Where in the code the issue occurs\n- What the correct reference should be (if determinable)\n\nIf no semantic errors are found, state 'NO SEMANTIC ERRORS FOUND'.",

Also identifies invalid specialization (FrontAxle :> RearAxle should be :> Axle). 0.5: Identifies 8-14 of the 17 errors. 0.0: Identifies fewer than 8 errors or many false positives.",
