# Implementation Prompts

This folder contains independent implementation prompts for each task category.
Each prompt file is self-contained and can be used by a separate AI agent.

## Available Prompts

| `prompt-analysis.md`       | Analysis       | 8     | Pending |

## How to Use

1. Open the prompt file for your assigned category
2. Copy the entire content and paste it as instructions to your AI agent
3. The prompt includes all necessary context, specifications, and guidelines
4. Use `.plan/local/` folder for any working notes (not committed to git)

## Local Planning

The `.plan/local/` folder is available for agent-specific planning files.
Files in this folder are ignored by git and won't be committed.
