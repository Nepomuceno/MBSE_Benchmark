  "prompt": "Transform this requirements document into a SysML v2 requirements package. For each requirement:\n\n1. Create a requirement def with the requirement ID as part of the name\n2. Add a doc string containing the requirement text\n3. Extract quantitative values as attributes with appropriate types (Distance, Time, Percentage, etc.)\n4. Create require constraints that express the requirement conditions\n5. Organize all requirements into a package named 'AutonomousDroneRequirements'\n\nExample mapping:\n- \"accuracy of ±2 meters\" → attribute targetAccuracy : Distance; require constraint { actualAccuracy <= targetAccuracy }\n- \"response time of less than 100 milliseconds\" → attribute maxResponseTime : Time; require constraint { responseTime < maxResponseTime }\n\nEnsure the output is valid SysML v2 syntax with proper imports if needed.",
