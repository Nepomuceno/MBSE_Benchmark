  "description": "Create a simplified 'black box' version of a model by removing internal implementation details while preserving the public interface",
  "prompt": "Create a simplified 'black box' version of this drone model that:\n\n1. Keeps only top-level part definitions (main system components)\n2. Removes internal implementation details (nested parts, internal attributes)\n3. Preserves external ports and interfaces that other models would use\n4. Maintains the public API of the system\n5. Keeps documentation strings for external-facing elements\n\nThe result should be usable as a library reference for other models without exposing implementation complexity. Think of it as creating an API specification - show what the system provides without showing how it works internally.\n\nOutput valid SysML v2 code that represents the simplified model.",
