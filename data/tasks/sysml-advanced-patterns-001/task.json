  "description": "Identify and analyze common SysML v2 modeling patterns used in a model, explaining their implementation and benefits.",
  "prompt": "Analyze this SysML v2 model and identify the following modeling patterns. For each pattern, indicate whether it is present, provide evidence, and explain its benefits:\n\n1. **Definition-Usage Pattern** - Are there clear separations between definitions (part def, port def, etc.) and their usages? Where are definitions vs usages?\n2. **Layered Architecture** - Is there separation between logical and physical layers, or between different levels of abstraction?\n3. **Interface Segregation** - How are interfaces and ports organized? Are they small and focused or large and monolithic?\n4. **Variation Points** - Where is variability modeled? Are there variants, specializations, or configuration points?\n5. **Requirements Allocation** - How are requirements linked to design elements? Are there satisfy relationships or allocations?\n\nFor each pattern, provide:\n- **Evidence**: Specific examples from the model (with element names and line references if possible)\n- **Benefits**: Why this pattern is beneficial for this model\n- **Recommendation**: If the pattern is missing or could be improved, suggest how\n\nReturn your analysis in markdown format with clear sections for each pattern.\n\nExample format:\n```markdown\n## Patterns Identified\n\n### 1. Definition-Usage Pattern ✓\n**Evidence:**\n- Part definition `Engine` defined at line X\n- Part usage `engine : Engine` at line Y\n- Multiple wheel definitions show reuse\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Single source of truth for component specifications\n- Enables reuse across configurations\n- Changes propagate automatically\n\n### 2. Layered Architecture ✗\n**Evidence:**\n- No clear separation between layers found\n- All elements at same abstraction level\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Consider separating logical decomposition from physical implementation\n```",
