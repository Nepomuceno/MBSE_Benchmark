If INVALID, identify the specific syntax error in the constraint expression\n3. Explain what the constraint is intended to verify\n\nPay attention to:\n- Proper constraint block syntax { }\n- Valid comparison operators (<=, >=, ==, !=)\n- Complete expressions (no missing operands)\n- Proper attribute references",
