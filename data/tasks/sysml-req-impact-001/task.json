  "prompt": "Analyze the impact of changing the vehicleMassRequirement constraint.\n\n**Scenario**: The vehicleMassRequirement changes from 2000 kg to 1800 kg.\n\nPerform a comprehensive impact analysis:\n\n1. **Affected Components**: Which components are directly affected by this change? (Hint: trace through satisfy relationships)\n\n2. **Constraint Analysis**: \n   - Calculate the current vehicle mass from component values\n   - Compare against the NEW requirement (1800 kg)\n   - Which constraints would now fail?\n   - By how much is the requirement violated?\n\n3. **Design Changes**: What design changes might be needed to meet the new requirement?\n   - Which components could be lightened?\n   - What are realistic mass reduction targets for each component?\n   - Are there any trade-offs to consider?\n\n4. **Cascading Effects**: Would this change impact any other requirements or constraints in the system?\n\nFormat your response with clear sections for each analysis point above.",

Calculates current mass (2410 kg) and new violation (610 kg over new limit). 0.5: Identifies some affected components but misses key elements or calculations. 0.0: Poor impact identification.",

      "change_suggestions": "1.0: Provides specific, realistic suggestions for mass reduction (e.g., lighter materials for transmission, smaller fuel tank, weight reduction for heavy components like engine/transmission). Considers trade-offs (e.g., engine power vs. mass, fuel capacity vs. range). 0.5: Provides suggestions but they are generic or lack detail. 0.0: Poor or no suggestions."
