Package Structure - hierarchy of packages\n3. Component List - all system elements with descriptions\n4. Objectives - system objectives with their IDs\n5. Attributes - key attributes and their purposes\n\nPreserve all semantic information from the model, including documentation strings, IDs, and relationships.
