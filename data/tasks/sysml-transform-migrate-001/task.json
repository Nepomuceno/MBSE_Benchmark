  "description": "Migrate a SysML v2 model from older patterns to modern best practices and conventions",
  "prompt": "This SysML v2 model uses some older patterns that should be updated to modern conventions:\n\n1. Replace connection defs with interface defs where representing bidirectional communication\n2. Convert direct attribute assignments (attribute x = value) to proper redefinitions (attribute redefines x = value)\n3. Add proper port conjugation (~) for bidirectional ports\n4. Replace redundant connections with bind statements where appropriate for data flow\n5. Use modern specialization syntax consistently\n6. Add documentation to explain the patterns being used\n\nModern pattern examples:\n- interface def PowerInterface { end source : PowerPort; end target : ~PowerPort; }\n- attribute redefines voltage = 24;\n- bind motor.power = controller.outputPower;\n\nModernize the model while preserving exact semantics - the model should behave identically but use current best practices.\n\nOutput valid SysML v2 code with modern patterns.",

      "syntax_correctness": "1.0: All modernized patterns use correct SysML v2 syntax (interface def with 'end' statements, 'attribute redefines' syntax, '~' for conjugation, 'bind' statement syntax). 0.5: Mostly correct but minor syntax issues. 0.0: Incorrect syntax for modern patterns.",
      "best_practices": "1.0: Result follows current SysML v2 best practices and conventions, improvements are appropriate and consistent throughout model. 0.5: Some best practices followed but inconsistent. 0.0: Does not follow best practices."
