Identify the child type (the one being defined)\n2. Identify the parent type (the one being specialized)\n3. Note the kind of definition (item def, part def, port def, etc.)\n\nReturn a JSON object with:\n- \"specializations\": array of objects with \"child\", \"parent\", and \"kind\" fields\n- \"hierarchy\": a text representation showing the inheritance tree\n\nExample format:\n```json\n{\n  \"specializations\": [\n    {\"child\": \"Car\", \"parent\": \"Vehicle\", \"kind\": \"part def\"},\n    {\"child\": \"Truck\", \"parent\": \"Vehicle\", \"kind\": \"part def\"}\n  ],\n  \"hierarchy\": \"Vehicle\\n  ├── Car\\n  └── Truck\"\n}\n```",
