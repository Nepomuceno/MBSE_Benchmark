  "prompt": "Analyze this SysML v2 model to distinguish between definitions and individuals.\n\nIn SysML v2:\n- **Definitions** (`part def`, `item def`, etc.) define types/classes\n- **Individuals** (`individual part`, specific usages) are specific instances\n- **Usages** (`part name : Type`) are instances of definitions\n\nFor this model:\n1. Identify all definitions (types)\n2. Identify all individual parts and usages (instances)\n3. Explain the typing relationship between them\n4. Note any redefinitions (`:>>` syntax)\n\nReturn a JSON object with:\n- \"definitions\": array of type definitions\n- \"individuals\": array of individual instances/usages\n- \"relationships\": array describing instance-of relationships\n- \"explanation\": explanation of the definition vs instance distinction\n\nExample format:\n```json\n{\n  \"definitions\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Person\", \"kind\": \"part def\", \"description\": \"Base person type\"}\n  ],\n  \"individuals\": [\n    {\"name\": \"judge\", \"type\": \"adult\", \"kind\": \"part usage\", \"multiplicity\": \"[1]\"}\n  ],\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\"individual\": \"judge\", \"instanceOf\": \"adult\", \"specializesFrom\": \"Person\"}\n  ],\n  \"explanation\": \"The model defines Person as a type, adult as a specialized usage, and judge as a specific individual...\"\n}\n```",
