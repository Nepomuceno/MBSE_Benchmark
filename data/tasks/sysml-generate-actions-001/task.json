Create three action definitions:\n   - GrindBeans: input coffeeBeans, output groundCoffee\n   - BrewCoffee: input groundCoffee and water, output brewedCoffee\n   - MakeCoffee: composite action that combines GrindBeans and BrewCoffee with proper flows\n4. Use proper action def syntax with in/out parameters\n5. MakeCoffee should use action usages and flow connections\n\nReturn only the SysML v2 code, no explanation.",
