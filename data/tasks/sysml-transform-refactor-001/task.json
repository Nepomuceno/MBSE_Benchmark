  "description": "Refactor a model by extracting port definitions into a separate package with proper imports",
  "prompt": "Refactor this SysML v2 model by extracting all port definitions into a separate package:\n\n1. Create a new package named 'PortDefinitions' containing all port def declarations (e.g., ForcePort)\n2. Create a new package named 'LawnmowerModel' containing the remaining definitions\n3. Add proper import statement in LawnmowerModel to import PortDefinitions::*\n4. Ensure all references to port definitions are resolved correctly\n5. Maintain all existing functionality and relationships\n\nOutput two separate SysML v2 files:\n- PortDefinitions.sysml\n- LawnmowerModel.sysml\n\nBoth files must be valid SysML v2 and the model should function identically after refactoring.",
