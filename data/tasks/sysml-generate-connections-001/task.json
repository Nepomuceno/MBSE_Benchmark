Assume these definitions exist:\n   - Controller with ports: sensorIn, actuatorOut\n   - Sensor with port: dataOut\n   - Actuator with port: commandIn\n3. Create:\n   - A part usage for each component (controller, sensor, actuator)\n   - Connect statements linking the ports:\n     * sensor.dataOut to controller.sensorIn\n     * controller.actuatorOut to actuator.commandIn\n   - An interface definition 'SensorInterface' for sensor-to-controller communication\n   - An interface definition 'ActuatorInterface' for controller-to-actuator communication\n4. Ensure all connections are properly typed and valid\n\nReturn only the SysML v2 code, no explanation.",
