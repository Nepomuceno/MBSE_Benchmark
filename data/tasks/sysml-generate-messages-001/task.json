Create three signal definitions (as attribute defs):\n   - StartCommand with attribute commandId : Integer\n   - StopCommand with attribute commandId : Integer\n   - StatusReport with attributes: status : String, timestamp : Integer\n3. Create port types that send/receive these signals:\n   - ControllerPort: sends commands, receives status\n   - DevicePort: receives commands, sends status\n4. Create a message sequence:\n   - Controller sends StartCommand to Device\n   - Device sends StatusReport back to Controller\n\nReturn only the SysML v2 code, no explanation.",
